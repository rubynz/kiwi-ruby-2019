            The Ruby community should reflect the diversity and vibrancy of New Zealand, and people from underrepresented backgrounds should have the opportunity to participate fully in our community.
          </p>
          <p class="kr-content_para">
              Thanks to <a href="https://ackama.com" target="_target">Ackama</a>, we are able to offer Diversity Scholarships for people who would otherwise not be able to afford to make it to Kiwi Ruby, but would benefit from attending.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scholarships cover the cost of a ticket and we may be able to cover your travel costs within New Zealand.
            Anyone is welcome to apply, but we’ll prioritise people from groups underrepresented in the Ruby community.
            <strong>Applications close Monday 30th of September</strong>, and we’ll contact all applicants by Monday 7th of October.
